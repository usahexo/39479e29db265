#  Primeira Liga clubs set for Casino Split

#

The 20 clubs of the Primeira Liga are set to vote on a proposal that would see them break away from their association with the Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) and create their own independent league.

#

The proposed breakaway has come about as a result of a long-running dispute between the clubs and the FPF over revenue sharing and financial control. The clubs feel that they are not being rewarded sufficiently for their role in generating income for the federation, while the FPF argue that they need to retain a degree of financial control in order to safeguard the future of Portuguese football.

#

A separate league would give the clubs more autonomy over their finances and allow them to negotiate directly with sponsors and broadcasters, giving them a greater share of the revenues generated. It would also enable them to set their own rules and regulations, which could help to attract new investors and improve the overall quality of Portuguese football.

#

However, there are some potential drawbacks to this proposal. One is that it could lead to a divide between the top tier clubs and those at the lower end of the table, who could struggle to compete in a separate league. There is also a risk that Portugal could be expelled from UEFA if they break away from the FPF, though this seems unlikely given that other leagues (e.g. Italy’s Serie A) have successfully split away in the past.

#  Portuguese football’s top-flight clubs to battle it out at the casino

In the heart of Lisbon, the Portuguese capital, some of the country’s top football clubs will battle it out for a place in next season’s Champions League. The teams will compete in the semi-final of the Taça de Portugal (Portuguese Cup) and one of the most iconic places in the city – Casino Estoril – will be the backdrop to this eagerly awaited clash.

The venue is not only well known for its award-winning casino but also its magnificent gardens which offer stunning views over the Atlantic Ocean. On matchday, fans of both Sporting CP and Benfica can enjoy these surroundings as they watch their teams do battle.

Sporting CP come into this fixture as slight underdogs, but they have pedigree in this competition, having won it on no fewer than four occasions. They are also unbeaten at home against Benfica in all competitions since 2010, winning two and drawing four games. In contrast, Benfica have lost on their last three visits to the Estádio José Alvalade.

Both clubs have had a mixed season domestically, with Sporting currently occupying 4th place in the Primeira Liga while Benfica sit 2nd. However, both sides will be determined to clinch victory in this semi-final and book their place in next month’s final.

The first leg takes place at the Estádio José Alvalade on Wednesday 3rd April, with kick-off at 21:15 CET. The return fixture is scheduled for Tuesday 9th April at the Estadio da Luz, with kick-off at 20:45 CET

#  Lisbon clubs to clash in new casino league

A new casino league is to be launched in Lisbon, with clubs from the city set to clash in a bid to become the top dog.

The league, which is set to get underway next month, will see eight clubs go head-to-head in a bid to win the league title.

The clubs involved are Casino Lisboa, Casino Estoril, Casino da Póvoa, Casino de Albufeira, Casino de Miraflores, Casino de Cascais, Casino do Porto and Casino da Madeira.

The league has been organised by the casinos themselves in a bid to drive footfall and revenue. Each club will play every other club once at their respective venue, with the overall winner being crowned at the end of the season.

It is hoped that the new league will help to reinvigorate the casino industry in Lisbon, which has seen declining visitor numbers in recent years.

Speaking about the new league, a spokesperson for Casino Lisboa said: "We're excited about this new venture and we're sure that it will be a big hit with our customers. These clubs represent some of the best that Lisbon has to offer and we can't wait to see them go head-to-head."

#  Benfica, Sporting Lisbon to clash in new casino-based football league

A new football league, exclusively based in casinos, is set to be launched next season. The LigaCasino has been created by Benfica and Sporting Lisbon, two of the biggest clubs in Portugal.

The new competition will see 12 teams battle it out for the title, with each club required to have a casino partner. The clubs will all be situated in the Lisbon area, with the exception of one team which will come from Madeira.

The format of the competition is yet to be decided, but it is thought that it could follow the model of the UEFA Champions League, with a group stage followed by a knock-out phase. Matches will take place either at the home ground of one of the teams or at a casino-based stadium.

“This league is a great opportunity for our club to grow further and strengthen our brand internationally,” said Joaquim Oliveira, CEO of Benfica. “We are looking forward to competing against Sporting Lisbon in this new venture.”

Sporting Lisbon’s president Bruno de Carvalho added: “This is an exciting project that will help us to increase our revenues and promote Portuguese football around the world. We are very proud to be working together with Benfica on this venture.”

#  PokerStars sponsors new Portuguese casino football league

PokerStars is one of the leading sponsors for the inaugural season of the Liga Portuguesa de Casino Football (LPFC), a new Portuguese casino football league. The league kicked off this month with 10 teams competing in a round robin tournament, with the top four teams qualifying for the playoffs.

The LPFC was created as a way to bring together Portuguese casino football enthusiasts and raise awareness of the sport in Portugal. The league is open to all players over 18 years of age, and teams are comprised of five players. Matches are played on casino-style blackjack and roulette tables, and each team is allowed two substitutes.

PokerStars ambassador Daniel Negreanu is one of the league's founders. "I'm really excited about the LPFC," he said. "It's a great opportunity for Portuguese casino football fans to come together and compete in a fun, challenging environment."

The LPFC has already attracted some top talent, including Portugal national team captain Bruno Alves. Alves, who is currently playing for Scottish club Rangers FC, said he was looking forward to playing in the league. "The LPFC is a great opportunity for Portuguese players to showcase their skills," he said. "I'm looking forward to competing against some of the best blackjack and roulette players in the country."

The league is scheduled to wrap up in early December, with the playoffs taking place later that month. The grand final will be held at PokerStars live event in Barcelona in January 2019.
