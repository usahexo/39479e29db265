#  Ratiopharm Ulm to face Gent in Europa League qualifiers

German side Ratiopharm Ulm have been drawn against Belgian outfit Gent in the Europa League qualifiers.

Ulm are no strangers to continental competition, having played in the Europa League twice before – most recently in the 2011/12 season. They reached the group stage that year, but were eventually knocked out by Sporting Lisbon.

Gent, meanwhile, are making their first appearance in Europe’s second-tier club competition. The Belgian side finished runner-up in their domestic league last season and will be looking to make a good impression on the European stage.

The first leg of the tie will take place at Ulm’s home ground on 25 July, with the return fixture taking place at Gent’s Ghelamco Arena on 1 August.

#  Ratiopharm Ulm to open Bundesliga season against Hoffenheim

The ratiopharm Ulm basketball club announced its 2018-2019 Bundesliga season opener against TSG 1899 Hoffenheim. The game will be held at ratiopharm arena on October 13th.

Ulm, currently in sixth place in the Bundesliga, is coming off a successful season in which it finished just two games out of the final playoff spot. The club boasts an impressive roster headlined by American swingman Torin Francis and Serbian guard Stefanos Domios.

Hoffenheim, who finished in fourth place last year and reached the playoffs, returns its core of German players including captain Robin Benzing and Nihad Djedovic. They will be looking to topple Ulm and take one of the top spots in the Bundesliga this season.

#  Ratiopharm Ulm hopes to build on successful season

Ratiopharm Ulm had a successful season in the Basketball Bundesliga, culminating in a fourth-place finish. The club will be looking to build on this next year and push for a place in the top three.

Ratiopharm Ulm was one of the most consistent sides in the Bundesliga last season. They suffered only two defeats after the turn of the year, which helped them to secure a fourth-place finish. This was an impressive feat, given that they were up against some of the biggest teams in Germany.

Next season, Ratiopharm Ulm will be looking to improve on this and push for a place in the top three. They have made some good signings over the summer, with most of their new additions coming from the lower leagues in Germany. These new players will need time to gel, but if they can do so, then they could be a force to be reckoned with.

One player who will be key for Ratiopharm Ulm next season is Nicolo Melli. The Italian is one of the most experienced players in the team and will be looking to lead them to success. He has already won several trophies in his career and will be hoping to add more next season.

Ratiopharm Ulm will also have high hopes for their young players. Players such as Josip Simunic and Philipp Schwethelm have shown great promise over the past few seasons and will be hopeful of making even more progress next year.

If Ratiopharm Ulm can continue playing at their current level then they have every chance of finishing in the top three next season. They have a strong squad and should not be underestimated by any of their opponents.

#  Coach Thorsten Leibold signs contract extension with Ratiopharm Ulm

After a successful season with Ratiopharm Ulm, coach Thorsten Leibold has signed a contract extension that will keep him with the club until 2021.

Leibold, who is in his second stint coaching Ulm, led them to a fourth-place finish in the Bundesliga last season. This was their best performance in the top flight since 2001.

“Thorsten has shown that he is a very good coach with a lot of potential,” said club president Michael Stockburger. “We are very happy to have him on board for the next few years.”

Leibold was also praised by his players. Guard Lucca Staiger said: “Thorsten has done an amazing job here. He knows how to get the best out of us and I’m really excited to continue working with him.”

Leibold played for German clubs Bayern Munich and VfL Wolfsburg during his playing career.

#  Player departures could mean opportunity for young players at Ratiopharm Ulm

Ratiopharm Ulm will have to fill the void left by departures of experienced players this summer. Players such as Joakim Noah, Bryce Drew and Dwayne Evans are moving on and their experience will be hard to replace. This could provide an opportunity for younger players on the team to step up and take on a larger role.

One player who could potentially benefit from this is Malcolm Miller. The 23-year-old forward has shown promise in his first two seasons with the team. He averaged 7.9 points and 3.3 rebounds last season while shooting 38 percent from 3-point range. Miller should see an increase in playing time with the departure of some of Ulm’s veterans and he could become a major contributor for the team.

Other young players who could see an increase in playing time include Philipp Schwethelm, Daniel Klostermann and Tim Ohlbrecht. All three players are 23 years old and have seen limited playing time over the past few seasons. They will each have an opportunity to show what they can do at the NBA level this upcoming season.

It will be interesting to see how Ratiopharm Ulm handles the departure of some of its veteran players. There is no doubt that they will miss their experience, but there is also a chance that this could open up opportunities for some of the younger players on the roster.
