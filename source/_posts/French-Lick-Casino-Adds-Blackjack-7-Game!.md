Blackjack is a beloved casino game for a reason: it's easy to learn but difficult to master. With just a few basic rules, you could be well on your way to winning big bucks at the casino. Blackjack 7 ups the ante by offering players an even better chance to win.

The premise of Blackjack 7 is simple: draw cards until you reach 21 or come as close as possible without going over. The key difference with this game is that you are playing against the dealer, not other players. In addition, the dealer must hit on 16 and stand on 17. This provides players with a greater opportunity to win, as they can take advantage of the dealer's weaker hands.

#  French Lick Casino Adds Exciting New Game - Blackjack 7!

The French Lick Casino has just announced the addition of a new and exciting game to its casino floor - Blackjack 7!

This new variation of blackjack offers players an opportunity to win big payouts with just seven cards. The game is played with a regular deck of 52 cards, and the object is to score as close to 21 as possible without going over.

The player's first two cards are face-up, and the dealer's first card is face-down. The player then has the option of hitting (taking another card), standing (ending the turn), doubling down (doubling the bet and taking one more card), splitting (splitting a pair into two separate hands), or surrendering (folding and losing half the bet).

After all players have had their turns, the dealer flips over the last card to reveal his or her hand. If the dealer's hand is 17 or higher, he must hit, regardless of what the player's hand is. If the dealer's hand is 16 or lower, he must stand. In either case, if the player's hand exceeds 21, he automatically loses.

Blackjack 7 offers some great potential payouts for skilled players. For example, a player who receives two 7s as his first two cards can win up to 1,000 coins on a single hand!

This new game is sure to be popular with blackjack fans at French Lick Casino, so be sure to give it a try!

#  Get in on the action with French Lick Casino's newest game - Blackjack 7!

If you're looking for an exciting new game to add to your casino repertoire, look no further than Blackjack 7! This cutting-edge variant of the classic card game is sure to get your blood pumping with its fast-paced action and myriad betting options.

To get started, players place their bets by choosing from one of three chip denominations: $1, $5, or $10. After all bets are placed, the dealer will deal two cards to each player - one face up and one face down. The goal is to reach 21 points without going over, and players can either hit (take another card) or stand (end their turn) as they see fit.

If the player's hand total exceeds 21 points, they automatically lose - no matter what the dealer's hand total is. In Blackjack 7, however, there's a special twist: if the player's first two cards are an Ace and a 10 value card (called a "blackjack"), they automatically win regardless of what the dealer has.

As in traditional blackjack, players can also choose to place side bets on various outcomes such as whether the next card will be black or red, or whether the dealer will bust. With so many possibilities for big wins, Blackjack 7 is sure to keep you entertained for hours on end!
