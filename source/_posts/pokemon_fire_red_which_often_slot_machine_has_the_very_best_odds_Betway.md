# Pokemon Fire Red: Which Slot Machine Has the Best Odds?

In Pokemon Fire Red, the Celadon City Game Corner is home to many slot machines. These slot machines offer various prizes, including coins that can be exchanged for rare Pokemon and TMs. However, not all slot machines are created equal, and some offer better odds than others. In this article, we will explore which slot machine in the Celadon City Game Corner has the best odds of winning.

Firstly, it is essential to understand how slot machines work in Pokemon Fire Red. Each slot machine has three reels, and each reel has 64 stops. The stops are a mixture of symbols, including the seven, the cherry, and the bar symbol. The player can bet up to three coins per spin, with each coin increasing the potential payout.

The odds of hitting the jackpot on a slot machine in Pokemon Fire Red are approximately 1 in 6,144. However, some slot machines offer better odds of winning than others. The slot machines in the Celadon City Game Corner are divided into two groups - those with an "Easy" payout slot machine and those with a "Hard" payout slot machine.

The "Easy" payout slot machines are located near the entrance of the Game Corner and are represented by the letters E and F. These machines offer a slightly better chance of winning than the "Hard" payout machines. The best "Easy" payout machine is the one on the far left, marked by the letter E. This machine has a payout rate of approximately 96.5%.

On the other hand, the "Hard" payout slot machines are located in the back of the Game Corner and are represented by the letters G and H. These machines offer a lower chance of winning, but the payout amounts are much higher. The best "Hard" payout machine is the one on the far right, marked by the letter H. This machine has a payout rate of approximately 96.7%.

It is essential to remember that slot machines are games of chance, and there is no guaranteed way to win. However, by choosing the right machine and using a bit of luck, players can increase their chances of hitting the jackpot.

In conclusion, if you're looking to win big at the Celadon City Game Corner in Pokemon Fire Red, the best slot machine to play is the "Hard" payout machine on the far right, marked by the letter H. While the odds of winning are lower, the potential payout is much higher than the "Easy" payout machines. Remember to gamble responsibly and have fun!
