#  How Slot Machine Poker Hands Work - Get the Basics Straight

Slot machines are a popular diversion in casinos. The game is simple: Insert your money, pull the lever (or push the button), and watch the symbols spin on the reels. If they line up in a winning combination, you get paid out according to a payout table. But what are those combinations, and how do they correspond to poker hands?

Most slot machines are based on the American version of poker, which uses five cards from a 52-card deck. The poker hand rankings are the same as in regular poker, with Royal Flush being the highest hand and a Pair being the lowest. In order to make a winning combination on a slot machine, your symbols need to match up with one of the pre-determined winning combinations listed on the payout table.

Here's a look at some of the most common winning combinations on slot machines:

Three of a Kind - A trio of matching symbols, such as three cherries or three 7s.

- A trio of matching symbols, such as three cherries or three 7s. Two Pairs - Two different matched pairs, such as two Jacks and two Queens.

- Two different matched pairs, such as two Jacks and two Queens. One Pair - Just one pair of any two matching symbols.

- Just one pair of any two matching symbols. High Card - When you don't have any of the previously mentioned hands, your highest card is your winning hand. For example, if you have an Ace, King, Queen, 5, and 4, your high card is an Ace.

Most slot machines will pay out for any combination that matches up with one of the winning combinations on the payout table. There are some exceptions (such as slots that only pay out for certain royal flush denominations), but for the most part, you'll be paid out if you get any 3-, 2-, or 1-of-a-kind symbol matches regardless of what they are.

#  How to Choose the Right Slot for Your Poker Hand 

One of the most important choices you'll make in poker is which slot to put your hand in. The right decision can mean winning a big pot, while the wrong decision can lead to a costly mistake.

There are three things to consider when making this decision: 
-Your opponent's likely hands
-Your own hand strengths and weaknesses
-The pot odds

Looking at your opponent's likely hands, you want to try and put them in as many difficult situations as possible. For example, if they're likely to have a high card, you'll want to put them in as early as possible. On the other hand, if they're more likely to have a pair or two pair, you'll want to wait until later in the hand.

Your own hand strengths and weaknesses are also important factors to consider. If you have a strong hand, you'll typically want to play it sooner rather than later. However, if your hand is weak, you may want to wait and see what develops. In addition, you need to be aware of how likely it is that you'll improve your hand by drawing. If the odds are good, you may want to pull the trigger even if your hand isn't very strong.

Finally, take into account the pot odds. This is simply the ratio of the size of the pot to how much it costs to call. If you think your chance of winning is better than the pot odds suggest, then it's usually worth calling. However, if your chance of winning is worse than the pot odds suggest, then it's usually best to fold.
