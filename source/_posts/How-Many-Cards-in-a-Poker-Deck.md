#  Poker Decks - How Many Cards in a Deck?

The number of cards in a deck is a topic of some debate. Some say that there are 52 cards in a deck, while others say that there are 54. The answer, however, is that there are 52 cards in a standard deck.

To understand why there are 52 cards in a deck, it's important to first understand how poker is played. In poker, each player is dealt with two cards, which are kept face down. After the player looks at their own cards, they can choose to either hold onto them or discard them and be given another card from the dealer. This process is repeated until all players have either five cards or have decided to stick with their two. The player with the best hand at the end wins the pot.

Now that we understand the basics of poker, let's look at how decks are made. A deck of cards consists of four suits - clubs (♣), diamonds (♦), hearts (♥), and spades (♠) - with 13 cards in each suit. There are also two wild cards - the joker and the deuce (2). If you take away these wildcards, then you're left with a standard deck of 52 playing cards.

This is because when you discard your two original cards and are given another one, it makes up for the card you discarded. So if you were originally dealt an ace and a two, but then discarded the ace and were given another card, your new hand would be two pair (two twos). This means that when you add up all of the individual card values in a deck, you get 364 (13x4 + 2x2 + 1x1). When you subtract out the wildcards, this leaves us with a total of 52 different playing cards in a deck.

Poker is a card game that has been around for centuries and is popular in casinos all over the world. The rules of poker can be simple or complex, but the goal is always to have the best hand possible and win the pot. 

In a poker game, there are usually six players, and each player is dealt five cards. The players then take turns betting on their hands. The player with the best hand at the end of the game wins. 

There are 52 cards in a deck, which means that there are 26 different hands possible in poker. In some games, like Texas Hold'em, players can use two of their cards to create a hand, so there are really 10 different hands possible. 

Some of the most common poker hands are: 
- One Pair: two cards of the same rank 
- Two Pairs: two pairs of cards with different ranks 
- Three of a Kind: three cards of the same rank 
- Straight: five consecutive cards of any suit 
- Flush: five cards of the same suit 
- Full House: three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank 
- Four of a Kind: four cards of the same rank 
- Straight Flush: five consecutive cards of the same suit
