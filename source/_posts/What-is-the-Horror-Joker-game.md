#  How to play the Horror Joker game?

The Horror Joker game is a great way to get your heart racing and your adrenalin pumping. It’s considered a horror game, because the aim of the game is to scare the other players as much as possible. The game can be played by anyone, regardless of age, and it’s perfect for a party or gathering with friends. In this article, we will show you how to play the Horror Joker game.

To start off, you will need at least two people to play the game. One player is selected to be the joker, while the other players are zombies. The joker can be any age and any gender, while the zombies must be at least 16 years old.

The game starts by dividing all of the players into two teams: zombies and humans. The humans are then divided into two groups: survivors and victims. The survivors are those who have not yet been turned into zombies, while the victims are those who have been turned into zombies. The survivors must protect the victims from being killed by the zombies.

The joker begins by choosing one victim and turning them into a zombie. The zombie then joins the other zombies in hunting down and killing all of the remaining survivors. The last survivor wins the game. If there are no more survivors left, then the joker wins the game.
