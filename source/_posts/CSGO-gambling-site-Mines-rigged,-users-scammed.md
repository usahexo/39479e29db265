#  CSGO gambling site Mines rigged, users scammed

For months, the CSGO community has been plagued by a number of CSGO gambling sites that have been rigged, resulting in users losing their skins and in some cases, their entire inventory.

One such site, Mines, has been at the center of these allegations, with users reporting that the site has refused to pay out winnings, or in some cases, has taken items without notice. In addition, there have been numerous reports of bots being used to artificially create wins and losses on the site.

Mines has been contacted for comment on these allegations but has failed to respond.

In light of these allegations, we would urge all CSGO players to avoid any and all CSGO gambling sites until further notice.

#  CSGO gambling site Mines shuts down following cheating allegations

CSGO gambling site Mines has announced that it will be shutting down in the wake of cheating allegations.

The site had been embroiled in controversy for some time, with accusations that its employees were using their positions to manipulate the odds in their favour.

In a statement on its website, Mines said that it had "no other choice" but to close its doors following the allegations.

"Mines has always been a fair and honest site, and we have never cheated our customers," the statement read. "However, we can no longer stand by and let the unfounded accusations against us continue."

The announcement comes just weeks after several high-profile CSGO gambling sites were forced to close their doors following similar allegations.

#  Belgian authorities investigate CSGO gambling site Mines

Belgian authorities have opened an investigation into the CSGO gambling site Mines, following numerous reports of minors being scammed out of large sums of money.

The Belgian Gambling Commission confirmed that it is investigating the site, which allows users to gamble with in-game items from the popular first-person shooter game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. The commission is looking into whether or not Mines is breaking Belgian gambling laws.

Mines allows players to bet on Coin Flip and Roulette games, with in-game items as the stakes. Many players, including minors, have lost large sums of money after placing bets on the site. Some users have reported losing thousands of dollars.

In a statement, the Gambling Commission said: "We are aware of this issue and we are currently investigating it."

The commission has not yet said whether or not it plans to take any action against Mines.

#  CSGO gambling site Mines fined by UK Gambling Commission

CSGO gambling site Mines has been fined by the UK Gambling Commission for offering unlicensed gambling services to British citizens.

The site, which allows players to gamble their in-game skins for real world money, has been ordered to pay a £7,000 fine and £8,000 in costs.

This is not the first time Mines has been penalized by the UKGC; the company was fined £10,000 in January of this year for similar offences.

"It is an offence to offer facilities for gambling without a licence," said Richard Watson, head of enforcement at the UKGC. "We will continue to take action against illegal gambling websites and work with our international partners to stamp out this activity."

Mines has been operating since early 2016 and currently services over 2.5 million users worldwide.

#  Major CSGO gambling site Mines announces closure

Mines, one of the largest and most popular CSGO gambling sites, has announced its closure. The surprise move leaves many customers out of pocket, as they have reportedly lost millions of dollars in deposits.

In a statement on the Mines website, the owners say that the site is being shut down due to "a long and difficult battle against cheaters". This is likely a reference to recent efforts by Valve to crack down on gambling with CSGO skins.

Mines was one of the first sites to offer betting on professional CSGO matches, and quickly grew in popularity. At its peak, it was handling over $2 million in bets per day.

The closure of Mines is likely to be a major blow to the CSGO gambling scene. Other sites such as csgoselector and csgobetting are expected to see a surge in traffic as players look for alternatives.
