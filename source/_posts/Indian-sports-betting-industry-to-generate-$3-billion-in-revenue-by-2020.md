#  Indian sports betting industry to generate $3 billion in revenue by 2020

The Indian sports betting industry is expected to generate $3 billion in revenue by 2020, according to a recent report by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and TechARC.

The report said that the growth of the industry will be fuelled by the increasing number of online gamers, rising income levels, and greater awareness about sports betting.

"The [sports betting] market is forecast to grow at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 16 percent and reach Rs. 2 trillion ($3 billion) by 2020," said the report.

The report also noted that there is a "substantial unmet demand" for sports betting in India, as only around 10 percent of the population engages in it.

The majority of this revenue will come from cricket betting, as it is the most popular sport in India. Other major sports that will contribute to the growth of the industry include football, tennis, badminton, and Formula One racing.

The online gaming market in India is currently worth around $1 billion, and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20 percent to reach $2.5 billion by 2020. This growth is being driven by rising income levels, increasing smartphone penetration, and an expanding youth population.

#  India is the world's fastest-growing market for illegal sports betting

India has the world’s fastest-growing illegal sports betting market, with nearly $60 billion in bets placed in 2017, up 10 percent from 2016, according to a new study by the European Union Intellectual Property Office.

By comparison, the legal sports betting market in Europe is worth just over $10.8 billion, the study said. Asia Pacific as a whole had about $189 billion in illegal sports bets last year, or 36 percent of all global wagers.

The booming illicit Indian market is mainly driven by cricket matches, which account for more than two-thirds of all bets placed there. The football World Cup held last year in Russia also generated a large number of illegal bets in India, the study found.

The findings underscore the challenges that regulators face in combating illegal sports betting and highlight the massive sums at stake in an industry that is often associated with corruption and match-fixing.

Illegal sports betting is not confined to India. It is pervasive in many countries around the world, including in Europe and the United States. But it is much harder to track and prosecute than gambling on casino games or other forms of legalized gambling.

As a result, authorities have generally paid less attention to it. And when they have tried to crack down on illegal sports betting, they have often faced resistance from bookmakers who have argued that they should be regulated just like the legal gambling industry.

But with billions of dollars wagered each year on illegal sports betting, there is growing recognition that such a strategy is not working. In India, for example, several state governments have begun to take steps to ban or regulate illegal sports betting amid concerns about its social and economic impacts.

#  Props betting taking center stage in Indian sports gambling market

The Indian betting market is seeing a surge in demand for props betting, with operators offering an ever-growing range of bets to appeal to customers.

The popularity of cricket in India has always made it a key focus for gambling companies, but the recent success of other sports, such as football and tennis, has meant that there is now greater demand for props betting on these games.

This growing demand has led to a number of new operators entering the market in recent months, including Play Games 24×7 and SportyBet. These companies are looking to gain a share of the lucrative Indian market by offering a wide range of bets, including props betting, on all the major sporting events.

While traditional fixed-odds betting is still popular in India, props betting is growing in popularity due to the wider range of bets that are available. This allows customers to bet on aspects of games that they are interested in, rather than just the outcome.

For example, a customer could bet on whether or not either team will score more than 2 goals in a football match, or how many sets will be played in a tennis match. This type of betting allows fans of sport to get more involved in the action and makes the games more exciting to follow.

The growth of online gaming has also helped to fuel the growth of props betting in India. With more people using their smartphones and laptops to access gambling websites, there is greater demand for innovative bets that can be placed online.

This trend is likely to continue in the years ahead as more and more Indians start to gamble online. This will provide a great opportunity for the new operators in the market, who can attract customers with their innovative bets and competitive odds.

#  Big opportunity for online sportsbooks in India's props betting market

Amidst the chaos of recent regulatory changes in the Indian gambling market, one opportunity has emerged for online sportsbooks: prop betting.

India's Supreme Court overturned a sweeping prohibition on all forms of gambling in September 2018, allowing states to individually legalize different types of gambling. While most states have yet to act, this opens the door for online sportsbooks to offer props betting to Indian players.

Prop betting is a type of wagering that takes place on events other than the final outcome of a game or match. For example, a player might bet on how many points a player will score in a particular game, or what the first goal scorer will be.

This type of wagering is growing in popularity all over the world, as it allows players to bet on aspects of games that they are more knowledgeable about and interested in. With so many different sporting events taking place every day, there are endless possibilities for prop bets.

Indian players are no strangers to prop betting; it has been popular in the country for many years in the form of illegal bookmaking. With online sportsbooks now able to offer this form of betting legally, the potential market is huge.

There are already a number of reputable online sportsbooks that accept players from India, and we can expect many more to enter the market in coming months. Sportsbetting operators who want to take advantage of this opportunity should make sure their site is fully compliant with Indian regulations and offers a wide range of props bets on popular sporting events.

#  Sports prop bets gaining popularity in India thanks to legalization efforts

As the world slowly moves towards legalizing sports betting, India is one of the countries that has seen a surge in popularity for prop bets. Prop bets, or proposition bets, are wagers placed on specific occurrences during a game rather than the final outcome. This type of betting offers gamblers more opportunities to make money and can add an extra level of excitement to watching a game.

The legalization of sports betting in India is still in its early stages, but there are already a number of online sportsbooks offering prop bets on cricket and other sports. The most popular prop bets include betting on the number of runs scored in an innings, the amount of wickets taken by a bowler, and the first player to score a century.

There are many factors that contribute to the increasing popularity of prop bets in India. First, the legalization efforts have made it easier for people to place wagers and have increased awareness about prop betting opportunities. Additionally, advances in technology have made it easier for people to bet on sports online, allowing them to follow games live and make wagers in real time.

Finally, Indian gamblers are becoming more sophisticated in their understanding of how to bet on sports. This has led to an increase in the number of people placing complex prop bets on things like whether the next ball will be a dot ball or whether both teams will score over 350 runs.

Overall, the growth of prop betting in India is a positive development for the gambling industry. It provides additional excitement for fans and gives them more opportunities to make money by correctly predicting game outcomes. As legalization efforts continue, we can expect this trend to grow even more popular in India and other countries around the world.
