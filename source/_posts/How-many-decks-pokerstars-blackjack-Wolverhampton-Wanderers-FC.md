#  How many decks pokerstars blackjack Wolverhampton Wanderers FC?

The origins of Wolverhampton Wanderers FC can be traced back to 1877, when the club was established as St. Luke’s FC. It wasn’t until 1879 that they adopted their current name of Wolverhampton Wanderers FC. They played their first ever game in November 1879 and recorded a 2-0 victory over local rivals Bilston Town.

The early years of the club were spent playing in regional leagues, before they eventually secured promotion to the Football League in 1908. They would go on to play in the top-flight for the first time in 1931 and enjoyed a number of successful seasons, including finishing as runners-up in the FA Cup in 1949.

The club endured a number of difficult years during the 1970s and 1980s, but they eventually returned to the top-flight in 1989. They would spend four seasons in the Premier League before being relegated in 1993. However, they would bounce straight back up and remained in the top-flight until 2004.

Wolves then suffered a second successive relegation and dropped down to League One. They narrowly missed out on promotion back to the Championship in 2009, but finally achieved promotion the following year. They have since been promoted and relegated twice, but currently reside back in the Championship.

As one of England’s oldest clubs, Wolves have won a number of major trophies over the years. These include three FA Cups, two league titles and one European Cup Winners’ Cup.
