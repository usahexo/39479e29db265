# How Much Will It Cost?

The interest rate on loans from Ignition Casino vary depending on your country of residence. However, the average interest rate is around 20%. This means that if you borrow $100, you will need to repay $120 plus interest.

# How Long Do I Have to Repay the Loan?

You will have 30 days to repay the loan in full. If you cannot make a payment within that timeframe, you may be subject to penalties and additional fees.
