When playing roulette, one of the most important things to understand is how the different payouts work. This will help you to make better bets and maximise your chances of winning.

There are a few different types of payout in roulette, which we'll look at in more detail below. The first is called a straight-up bet, which is when you bet on a single number. If this number comes up, then you win 35 times your bet amount.

Another type of payout is a split bet, which is when you place your bet on two adjoining numbers. If either of these numbers come up, then you win 17 times your bet amount.

A street bet is when you place your bet on three consecutive numbers on the front or back row of the table. If any of these numbers come up, then you win 11 times your bet amount.

Finally, there's the corner bet, which is when you place your bet on four adjoining numbers. If any of these come up, then you win 8 times your bet amount.

#  Understanding what each number pays is essential for a successful game of roulette 

Players at the roulette table always want to increase their chances of winning, but they might not know how the different numbers payout. Understanding what each number pays is essential for a successful game of roulette.

The payouts on American roulette are as follows: 
1 to 1 – A bet on a single number pays out if the ball lands on that number. 
2 to 1 – A bet on a split (two adjacent) number pays out double the amount wagered. 
3 to 1 – A bet on a corner (four adjacent) number pays out triple the amount wagered. 
5 to 1 – A bet on a street (three adjacent) number pays out five times the amount wagered. 
6 to 1 – A bet on two adjacent streets ( six numbers in total) pays out six times the amount wagered. 
7 to 1 – A bet on three adjacent streets ( nine numbers in total) pays out seven times the amount wagered. 8 to 1 -A 4-number corner bet (eight numbers in total) pays out eight times the original wager. 
11 to 1 -A 5-number line bet (eleven numbers in total) pays out eleven times the original wager.
17 to 1 -A 6-number corner bet (twelve numbers in total including zero and double zero) pays out seventeen times the original wager.

30 to 1 -A 7-number line bet (thirteen numbers in total including zero and double zero) pays thirty times the original wager.

#  Check out this guide to see how much you could potentially win when betting on specific numbers

There is no one definitive answer to this question. However, if you take a look at the odds for each number, you can get a general idea of how much you could win.

For example, the odds of winning are 1 in 36 for a single number bet. This means that if you wager $1 on a single number, your potential payout would be $36. So, in this instance, you would stand to win $35 if your chosen number comes up.

On the other hand, the odds of winning are 1 in 292 for a two number bet. So if you wagered $1 on two numbers, your payout would be $292 if both numbers won. This means that you would win back $291 if just one of your chosen numbers came up.

As you can see, the odds and potential payouts vary depending on the type of bet that you make. However, by taking a look at the odds for each number, you can get a good idea of how much money you could potentially win.
