        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="Portuguese-footballers-ruled-by-black-number-once-again"><a href="#Portuguese-footballers-ruled-by-black-number-once-again" class="headerlink" title="Portuguese footballers ruled by black number once again"></a>Portuguese footballers ruled by black number once again</h1><p>Portugal was again under the leadership of a black number. CR7, the world-wide superstar, not only led the Portuguese team to their fourth European title but also became the top scorer of all time in this tournament. </p>
<p>Cristiano Ronaldo’s decisive penalty against France in the final of the UEFA Euro 2016 gave Portugal their first major trophy ever. This has been hailed as one of the biggest upsets in international football history and as an even greater achievement due to the economic and political turmoil that Portugal is currently going through.</p>
<p>It would be unfair to attribute all of Portugal’s success solely to Ronaldo, but his electric form throughout the tournament was certainly a major factor. The Real Madrid player managed to score three goals in six matches, including a hat-trick against Hungary in the group stages.</p>
<p>Many experts argue that this Championship win is just a taste of things to come for Ronaldo and Portugal. The 33-year-old shows no signs of slowing down and with talents such as Renato Sanches and Bernardo Silva in the squad, there is no doubt that Portugal will be a force to be reckoned with for years to come.</p>
<h1 id="Black-dominates-at-Portuguese-gambling-tables-too"><a href="#Black-dominates-at-Portuguese-gambling-tables-too" class="headerlink" title="Black dominates at Portuguese gambling tables, too"></a>Black dominates at Portuguese gambling tables, too</h1><p>In Portugal, black is the color of good luck at gambling tables. Black dominates at Portuguese gambling tables, too, just as it does in other countries around the world.</p>
<p>Casinos have long sought to associate the color black with positive outcomes and good fortune. This is likely due to the psychological effects of the color on people’s moods and emotions. Black is often seen as powerful, elegant, and sophisticated. It can be calming in some cases and create a sense of mystery in others.</p>
<p>The popularity of black at casinos has led to its use in other areas of casino culture as well. Blackjack dealers often wear black uniforms and many casinos use blackjack tables with green felt surfaces. In fact, many people think of black when they think of gambling overall.</p>
<p>This isn’t limited to land-based casinos, either. Online casinos often use black as their primary color scheme, too. This is likely because it is seen as a sign of sophistication and luxury.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt that the color black has a long history with gambling and casinos. And there’s no doubt that it will continue to be a popular choice for many years to come.</p>
<h1 id="Numero-zero-another-bad-omen-for-Portuguese-championship"><a href="#Numero-zero-another-bad-omen-for-Portuguese-championship" class="headerlink" title="Numero zero: another bad omen for Portuguese championship?"></a>Numero zero: another bad omen for Portuguese championship?</h1><p>The Portuguese football championship is turning into a farce. The latest debacle was the game between Porto and Sporting, which ended in a scoreless draw. This means that Porto, the team that is leading the championship, has not won any of their last six games. </p>
<p>In order to understand how absurd this situation is, it is enough to compare it with the English Premier League. Manchester City, the team that is leading that championship, has won all but one of its games. And even the team in second place, Liverpool, has more wins than Porto. </p>
<p>One possible explanation for this poor performance is that Porto doesn’t have enough quality players. Another possibility is that the coach isn’t doing a good job. But the most likely explanation is that there is something wrong with the Portuguese football system. </p>
<p>This problem was already evident last year, when Porto lost the Champions League final against Monaco. Monaco was a much weaker team than Porto, but they were able to win because they were better organized and had better players. </p>
<p>The current situation reinforces the suspicion that the Portuguese football system is flawed and needs to be reformed. This will not be an easy task, given the resistance of the traditional clubs and their powerful lobbies. But it is necessary if we want to see our national team compete successfully in international tournaments.</p>
<h1 id="Does-black-magic-have-a-spell-on-Liga-Nos"><a href="#Does-black-magic-have-a-spell-on-Liga-Nos" class="headerlink" title="Does black magic have a spell on Liga Nos?"></a>Does black magic have a spell on Liga Nos?</h1><p>The Portuguese top flight, Liga Nos, is well known for its highly competitive and unpredictable nature. With 14 rounds of matches played, the competition for European places is heating up, and teams at the bottom are starting to feel the pressure. </p>
<p>However, this season seems to be a little different. While there have been some fantastic games and surprising results, one team has consistently sat at the top of the table: Benfica. The Eagles currently have a five-point lead over their nearest rivals and show no sign of slowing down. </p>
<p>But how has Benfica managed to achieve such success? Some observers say that they have a spell over the other teams in the league, thanks to their use of black magic. This accusation was first made by Paulo Sousa, former coach of Porto – one of Benfica’s biggest rivals. </p>
<p>Sousa said that he felt “uneasy” about facing Benfica, and claimed that their coach Rui Vitoria was using black magic to gain an advantage over his opponents. “I don’t know what they do [at Benfica] but it certainly has an effect,” said Sousa. “They have some sort of voodoo or black magic which helps them win matches.” </p>
<p>Others were sceptical about Sousa’s allegations, noting that he had previously been sacked by both Porto and Leicester City – two clubs which are not exactly known for their magical prowess. However, even if there is no truth to Sousa’s claims, they have certainly generated a lot of media attention and added an extra layer of intrigue to this season’s Liga Nos campaign. </p>
<p>So far, Benfica have shown no signs of being affected by the accusations of black magic and continue to lead the league standings. Whether they can maintain their grip on first place until the end of the season remains to be seen, but with so many twists and turns still to come, anything is possible.</p>
<h1 id="Colour-of-failure-roulette-wheel-tips-Portugal’s-top-football-league"><a href="#Colour-of-failure-roulette-wheel-tips-Portugal’s-top-football-league" class="headerlink" title="Colour of failure: roulette wheel tips Portugal’s top football league"></a>Colour of failure: roulette wheel tips Portugal’s top football league</h1><p>The Primeira Liga, Portugal’s top football league, kicked off on the 18th of August. This season sees reigning champions Benfica start as favourites to retain their title, with Sport Lisboa e Benfica (SLB) priced at 2&#x2F;1 to win the championship at the time of writing. The Eagles will be looking to make it four titles in a row and secure their place in the history books. With FC Porto and Sporting CP also expected to be in the running, it should be another exciting season in Portugal.</p>
<p>As always, there will be a few teams who are tipped for relegation and we take a look at three of them below. Vitória Guimarães, Desportivo Aves and Paços de Ferreira are all at long odds to stay up this season, with all three available at over 100&#x2F;1 to win the league. So if you’re looking for some outside tips for this season’s Primeira Liga, why not have a flutter on one of these three clubs?</p>
<p>Vitória Guimarães finished in 14th place last season and they’ll be looking to improve on that this year. They’ve brought in some new players over the summer, including the experienced defender Braga from Vitória Setúbal and striker Raphinha from Celta Vigo. However, they may find it tough going against some of the bigger teams in the league.</p>
<p>Desportivo Aves were promoted from the Segunda Liga last season and they’ll be looking to stay up this year. They’ve made a good start to life back in the top flight, picking up four points from their first two games. They’ve got some dangerous attacking players, including former Portuguese international Hugo Almeida.</p>
<p>Paços de Ferreira were relegated from the Primeira Liga last season and they’ll be looking to bounce back this year. They’ve made a couple of signings over the summer, including defender Luís Emanuel from Moreirense FC. However, they may find it tough going against some of the bigger teams in the league.</p>
