      		<h1 id="Couple-Forced-to-Divorce-After-Gambling-Debt-Goes-Unpaid"><a href="#Couple-Forced-to-Divorce-After-Gambling-Debt-Goes-Unpaid" class="headerlink" title="Couple Forced to Divorce After Gambling Debt Goes Unpaid"></a>Couple Forced to Divorce After Gambling Debt Goes Unpaid</h1><p>When debt goes unpaid, the consequences can be serious. This was the case for a British couple who were forced to divorce after their gambling debt went unpaid. The husband had racked up a debt of over £100,000, and when the wife refused to help him pay it off, he left her for another woman.</p>
<p>The man had started gambling as a way to make money after he was laid off from his job. He quickly lost all of his savings, and then started borrowing money from friends and family to keep playing. Finally, the debt became too much for him to handle and he was forced to sell his house and car to pay it off.</p>
<p>When the wife found out about the debt, she refused to help him pay it off. She said that she didn’t want her children growing up knowing that their parents had been divorced because of gambling debts. The husband then left her for another woman who was willing to help him pay off his debts.</p>
<p>Gambling can have serious consequences for both the individual and their loved ones. If you find yourself in too much debt because of gambling, it’s important to get help before it’s too late. There are many organisations that can offer support and guidance, so don’t be afraid to ask for help.</p>
<h1 id="Couple-Loses-Home-After-Failing-to-Prove-Gambling-Addiction"><a href="#Couple-Loses-Home-After-Failing-to-Prove-Gambling-Addiction" class="headerlink" title="Couple Loses Home After Failing to Prove Gambling Addiction"></a>Couple Loses Home After Failing to Prove Gambling Addiction</h1><p>John and his wife, who asked to remain anonymous, lost their home after the court determined they could not prove they had a gambling addiction. The couple argued that their mortgage company should have never foreclosed on their home because of their addiction, but the court sided with the mortgage company.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to lose your home like that,” John said. “We were really counting on the fact that we could prove our addiction to the court and get our home back, but it didn’t work out that way.”</p>
<p>John and his wife are not alone in this struggle. A recent study by the American Journal of Public Health found that between 2.3 and 5 percent of all adults in the United States have a gambling addiction. This means that millions of people could be at risk of losing their homes if they can’t prove their addiction to a court.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction is a serious problem, and it’s important to get help if you think you might have a problem. If you’re having trouble controlling your gambling habit, talk to your doctor or someone else you trust about getting help.</p>
<h1 id="Judge-Orders-Couple-to-Pay-Back-Gambling-Debt-or-Go-to-Jail"><a href="#Judge-Orders-Couple-to-Pay-Back-Gambling-Debt-or-Go-to-Jail" class="headerlink" title="Judge Orders Couple to Pay Back Gambling Debt or Go to Jail"></a>Judge Orders Couple to Pay Back Gambling Debt or Go to Jail</h1><p>A Michigan couple has been ordered by a judge to either pay back their $75,000 gambling debt or go to jail.</p>
<p>The husband and wife, who have not been identified, racked up the debt in just two years while gambling at a local casino.</p>
<p>In addition to the debt, the couple owes more than $27,000 in interest and penalties.</p>
<p>They have been given one month to come up with a payment plan or face jail time.</p>
<p>The order marks the latest development in a long-running battle between the casino and the gamblers.</p>
<p>The casino sued the couple in 2017 seeking repayment of the debt.</p>
<p>A lower court ruled in favor of the casino, but that decision was overturned by an appeals court last year.</p>
<p>The appeals court ruled that the casino could not garnish the couple’s wages as they were not employed.</p>
<p>It is not clear how the couple plans to pay back the money.</p>
<h1 id="Couple-Struggles-to-Prove-Gambling-Addiction-for-Bankruptcy-Protection"><a href="#Couple-Struggles-to-Prove-Gambling-Addiction-for-Bankruptcy-Protection" class="headerlink" title="Couple Struggles to Prove Gambling Addiction for Bankruptcy Protection"></a>Couple Struggles to Prove Gambling Addiction for Bankruptcy Protection</h1><p>A Colorado couple is struggling to prove their gambling addiction for bankruptcy protection. The husband and wife duo has been in a legal battle for over two years to prove that their gambling addiction was the root of their financial woes. </p>
<p>The couple has maintained they only started gambling to try and make money to pay off their mounting bills, but eventually lost everything they had due to their addiction. They are now $500,000 in debt and have resorted to filing for bankruptcy. </p>
<p>While the court understands that gambling addiction is a real problem, proving that it was the cause of this particular financial disaster has been difficult. The couple will need to provide detailed records of all of their gambling activity, as well as testimonies from friends and family members who can attest to the fact that the couple’s money woes were caused by their gambling addiction. </p>
<p>This case could set an important precedent for other couples who find themselves in a similar situation. Bankruptcy can be a lifesaver for those struggling with overwhelming debt, but it is often difficult to prove that all of your debt is not simply the result of bad luck or irresponsible spending habits. If this Colorado couple is successful in proving their gambling addiction, it could open up avenues for others who are facing similar financial struggles.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Debt-Threatens-Marriage-What-If-We-Don’t-Have-Proof"><a href="#Gambling-Debt-Threatens-Marriage-What-If-We-Don’t-Have-Proof" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Debt Threatens Marriage: What If We Don’t Have Proof?"></a>Gambling Debt Threatens Marriage: What If We Don’t Have Proof?</h1><p>Gambling debt has become a common issue in marriages, with one spouse often hiding their addiction from the other. In some cases, this debt can even lead to threats of divorce or legal action.</p>
<p>But what happens if you don’t have any proof of the gambling debt? This can be a difficult situation to resolve, as the spouse who gambled may not be willing to admit to any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>In this case, you may need to consider hiring a lawyer to help negotiate the debt. You may also want to consider seeking out therapy or support groups, as this type of addiction can be quite damaging to a relationship.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it’s important that both spouses work together to resolve the gambling debt issue. If one spouse is unwilling to cooperate, it will be much more difficult to come up with a solution.</p>
